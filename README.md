The main features included in the site will be as follows:
- [X] Event Calendar: An interactive calendar displaying all upcoming events on campus, allowing students to plan their participation.
- [X] News and Announcements: A dedicated section for news and important announcements, ensuring quick and transparent communication.
- [X] Club and Activities Pages: Dedicated pages for each club and activity group, showcasing their events, meetings, and specific activities.
- [X] Event Registration: The ability for students to register online for events, facilitating participant management.
- [X] Image Gallery: A visual feature to share photos and videos of past events, creating a visual archive.
- [X] Discussion Forum: An interactive space where students can discuss, exchange ideas, and participate in discussions on various campus-related topics.
- [X] Social Media Integration: Integration of social media feeds to allow students to stay informed and engaged through these popular platforms.

The overall objective is to create a user-friendly web platform that enhances the student experience, encourages active participation, and strengthens the sense of community within the institution. This project aims to meet the specific needs of students by providing easy access to information and fostering transparent and effective communication.

## USER STORY:
- A title
- The priority level
- User story estimation
- The format “As”, “I wish”, “in order to”
- The acceptance criteria that I explain to you further

### As a 'user or role type', I want 'a goal' for that 'a reason'.
